# Project Title:  Java Clock

## Motivation: 
In this project I will build a basic 'clock' programme using Java. <br />

## Notes:

## Criteria:
Write a class Clock that implements a main method, similar to the previous exercise.<br />
Implement this method so it prints the current time in the terminal, like this:<br />

java Clock.java <br />
The current time is 15:05 <br />
